            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Will't always blow? will't never more be dry?</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>O <hi>Britain,</hi> once the Glory of all Iſles,</l>
                  <l>Where are thy Joys, where are thy grateful Smiles,</l>
                  <l>That bleſt thy Natives, and reviv'd Exiles?</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Alas! thy Queen is gone, our Joys are fled,</l>
               <l>Haſtning with her to ſink among the Dead:</l>
               <l>By Mortal Eyes ſhe can no more be ſeen;</l>
               <l>That Earthly Goddeſs now's a Heav'nly Queen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Think her return'd to her Celeſtial home;</l>
               <l>For, ſure, from Heav'n alone ſuch wondrous Worth cou'd come.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Some flame divine inform'd the brighteſt Clay,</l>
                  <l>Taught Queens to rule, and Subjects to obey;</l>
                  <l>Then left our gloomy World, for the bright Realms of Day.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>The Royal Soul no longer is confin'd;</l>
               <l>But fills a Sphere exalted as her Mind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With Clouds of Vice long was our Iſle o'reſpread,</l>
               <l>Led by a Prince who was himſelf miſſed;</l>
               <l>But when <hi>Maria</hi> grac'd the vacant Throne,</l>
               <l>The Darkneſs vaniſht, as her Vertues ſhone.</l>
               <l>Cheer'd by her Beams, enlighten'd, and refin'd,</l>
               <l>Each ſoon new-modell'd his unpoliſht mind.</l>
               <l>She like the Sun extenſive, did diſpence</l>
               <l>On all a kind and equal Influence:</l>
               <l>Diſorder ceas'd, ſhe ſaw and overcame;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Bleſt Change! Religion now and Laws prevail'd,</l>

               <l>Among the Great true Merit purchas'd Fame,</l>
               <l>And to be honeſt was no ſland'rous Name.</l>
               <l>So much ſhe Vertue lov'd, and Vice did hate,</l>
               <l>That ſtill ſhe thought the Good, the only Great.</l>

               <l>Or in <hi>Maria</hi> Heav'n did more beſtow.</l>

               <l>Ye dark Retreats, where Poverty is found</l>
               <l>Detain'd by Shame, and lingring on the ground,</l>
               <l>Where Want and Woe each other ſtrive t' outdo,</l>
               <l>You know what Alms flow'd down from her to you!</l>
               <l>The grateful Poor have much of this reveal'd,</l>
               <l>But more, much more her pious Care conceal'd:</l>
               <l>For ſtill ſhe ſought that only Heav'n ſhould know</l>
               <l>What for its ſake ſhe hourly did beſtow.</l>
               <l>In this alone profuſe, elſe always juſt,</l>
               <l>She ſeem'd to hold her Treaſures but in Truſt.</l>
               <l>Wiſe, pious, humble, ſhe in greatneſs ſtood</l>
               <l>Angelically fair, and as divinely good:</l>
               <l>As if her Soul all Vertue had engroſt,</l>
               <l>Not a whole Age of more could juſtly boaſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tho much ſhe did, ſtill more ſhe would have done,</l>
               <l>Had not from Heav'n her Summons come ſo ſoon:</l>
               <l>A Summons terrible to all but her,</l>
               <l>Who Heav'ns juſt Will did to her own prefer;</l>
